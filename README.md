# belly-button-challenge
 
The code for this challenge creates an Interactive Dashboard which allows an inside to the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dashboard shows the catalogs of microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## There are 5 steps in this challenge.
1.	Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.

2.	Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3.	Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

4.	Display the sample's metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5.	Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard.
